DJI Osmo Action 4 User Manual
Slow Motion

Supports 4x or 8x slow-motion video shooting. In Slow Motion mode,
the camera records the video with a high frame rate and slows the
footage down to 4x or 8x the normal speed during playback. Slow
Motion catches details not visible to the naked eye, which is ideal for
fast-action shots. Note: slow-motion videos do not include audio. The
audio file is stored as a standalone file and has the same path as the
videos, which can be transferred to your computer.

Timelapse

Select from Hyperlapse and Timelapse. In this mode, the camera
turns long events into short videos by taking a frame of video at set
intervals.
Use Hyperlapse to record smooth timelapse videos when the camera
is in motion (such as in a car or when held in the hand). Use Timelapse
to record timelapse videos when the camera is mounted and still.
Three presets in Timelapse are designed for typical scenes such as
Crowds, Clouds, and Sunset. Users can also optimize the interval and
duration for recording timelapse videos.
