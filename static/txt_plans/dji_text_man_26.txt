Shooting Modes

Description

Hyperlapse

Use Hyperlapse to record smooth timelapse videos when
the camera is in motion (such as in a car or when hand-held).
Tap Playback to preview timelapse videos as soon as they are
captured.

Timelapse

Use Timelapse to record timelapse videos when the camera is
mounted and still. Three presets in Timelapse are designed for
typical scenes such as Crowds, Clouds, and Sunset. Users can also
optimize the interval and duration for recording timelapse videos.

Slow Motion

Supports 4x or 8x slow-motion video shooting. In Slow Motion
mode, the camera records the video with a high frame rate and
slows the footage down to 4x or 8x the normal speed during
playback. Slow Motion catches details not visible to the naked
eye, which is ideal for fast-action shots. Note: slow-motion videos
do not include audio. The audio file is stored as a standalone file
and has the same path as the videos, which can be transferred to
your computer.

Photo
